name:               packcheck
version:            0.6.0
synopsis:           Universal build and CI testing for Haskell packages
description:
  This package contains a universal CI/build script @packcheck.sh@ and config
  files designed such that you can just copy over @.travis.yml@, @appveyor.yml@
  or @.circleci/config.yml@ to your package repo and your package is CI ready
  in a jiffy.  You can build and test packages on local machine as well. For
  local testing, copy @packcheck.sh@ to your local machine, put it in your
  PATH, and run it from your package directory:
  .
  > $ packcheck.sh cabal-v2
  > $ packcheck.sh stack
  .
  You can try the script on this package itself. It builds and comprehensively
  sanity tests a Haskell package across build tools (stack/cabal), uniformly,
  consistently and across all platforms (Linux\/MacOS\/Windows).  You do not
  need to be familiar with any of the build tools to use it.
  .
  This is also a minimal yet complete model package (with tests, benchmarks, CI
  already working) that can be used as a starting point to develop a new
  package. Beginners can use it to learn about haskell package metadata
  structure, benchmarks, tests, CI configs etc.
  .
  See the README for comprehensive documentation.
